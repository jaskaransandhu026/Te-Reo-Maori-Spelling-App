## Meeting 6

**Updated quiz layout**
Due to the change in requirements with the final project, we rethought the layout of the different quiz components. 
 - Moved progress bar to the top
 - Moved the hint to the centre of the screen (fill-in-the-gaps / hangman style)
 - Moved the textfield to the bottom of the screen
 - Removed the skip button and encouraging message
 - Moved the repeat icon to the left of the textfield  
 - Added a timer label
 - Added a topic image
 
 **Updated results screen**
  - Added a tableview on the results screen to contain a summary of the words tested
  - Added a topic image and removed the star rating

**Added logic for practice module and games module**
 - We decided to use the same controller and fxml for both modules to reduce code duplication 

**Updated images**
 - One of the problems we faced when using images and icons on the interface was that they were too pixelated. We found the fix for this was to resize the images externally (to a size close to the prefWidth of the imageview) and replace the files in the repository.

**Added quiz/practice logic**
 - Ensured pauses happened at sensible times eg. disable textfield after entering text to prevent errors from spamming input. 
 - Implemented hint label showing the correct number of underscores and punctuation

**Implemented scoring system**
 - Score increases based on time taken to correctly enter the word 

**Implemented countdown timer**
 - Timer counts down and resets on the next word
 - TODO: give the user a time limit based on the length of the word being spelt

**Implement topic images on quiz scene and results scene**
 - Image matches topic being tested
 - Implemented by passing in the image from topic to quiz to results scene

**Implemented results table**
 - Created a Questions.java class with fields: word, answer, isCorrect
 - Answer is coloured based on if it was marked correct or not
