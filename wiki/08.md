## Meeting 8

**Tooltips**
 - Kept only the tooltips linked to buttons as these ones are more useful (and we didn't want to overcrowd the interface)
 - Changed delay back to default duration to avoid unintentionally showing tooltips when user is about to click a button
 - Updated text

**Help Button**
 - Moved pop up to a separate fxml and controller file for better code resuability and modifiability

**Toolbar**
 - Buttons are now semi-transparent so they don't pop out as much
 - We wanted to more clearly distinguish the two groups of buttons with the addition of another menu button and another toolbar button

**Scoreboard**
 - Removed the option to order the scores from highest to lowest (this is the default)
 - Changed alert box from "scores cleared!" to "are you sure you want to clear the scoreboard?"
 - Reformatted date from 2021-08-31 to 31 August 2021
 - Scoreboard results are now stored in a (hidden) file so results are persistent even after the game closes

**Other updates**
 - Updated hex values for red and green to be distinguishable by the colour blind
 - Updated images on help pop up
 - Updated colours on help pop up to make the "close" button more distinguishable from the image
 - Refactoring, keeping variable names consistent, commenting, reconstraining layout etc
